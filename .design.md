This repository contains Python-based services that are partially following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern. The services use FastAPI and protocol/provider pairs provided by the [hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.

This repository will be eventually refactored and split into three separate services.
